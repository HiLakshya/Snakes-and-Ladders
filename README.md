<h1>🎲Snakes-and-Ladders</h1>
<hr><p>C++ program for creating &amp; simulating a Snake &amp; Ladder Game. Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic.</p><h2>ℹ️ General Information</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>Gameplay:
The players will move their pieces from left to right, starting at 1, following the numbers on the board, then the next row from right to left and repeat.</li>

<li>🐍Snakes:
When a player lands on a top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake.</li>
<pli>Ladders:
When a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder.</li>
<li>🏆Winning the Game:
The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game. To win the player will need to roll the exact number to get you to the last space. If the player rolls a higher number than needed to land exactly on 100, their piece does not move and remains there until their next turn, when they can roll again.</li></ul>
